# Just a movie app.

I'm not trying to re-invent the wheel with this app. I just really enjoy movies and thought something like this would be fun, while laying the groundwork for future stuff related to movies.

This is an app made using Node.js, NPM, and HTML.

It uses the OMDb API and a movie's IMDb ID as an input, and then outputs that movie's real title, the runtime in minutes, and the IMDb's long-form listing of the plot.
